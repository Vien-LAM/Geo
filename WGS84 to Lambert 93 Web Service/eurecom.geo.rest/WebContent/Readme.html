<body>
The API is working through URL like any RESTful service does. The syntax for the service is (note that {} is required and [] is optional):
http://{domainname}/eurecom.geo.rest/api/converter/{D1}[P1]{D2}[P2]?{Parameters}
Where:
domainname: Eurecom domain name.
D1 and D2: Datum of source and target CRS respectively.
P1 and P2: Projection of source and target CRS respectively.
Parameters: The required parameters as input to the service. See table below for detail of required parameters for each converter. Parameters are provided as p1=v1&p2=v1 where p1 is parameter 1 with v1 is its value, etc.

Table 2.1 - API Parameters
The API also support batch converter by using file. The URL syntax is:
http://{domainname}/eurecom.geo.rest/api/converter/file/{D1}[P1]{D2}[P2]?{Parameters}
Where D1, P1, D2, and P2 is as before. The parameters is as in table below:
Parameters	Unit	Possible value
Symbol	Name		
source	The source file	String	The URI to the file
encode	The file's encoding system	String	Any file encoding system, e.g. UTF-32
Table 2.2 - Batch converter parameters
The format of each line in the file is the same and base on the converter, the number of inputs is as in table 2.1. The format is as follow:
V1 V2 V3 V4
Where V1, V2, V3, and V4 are the value of each require input for each coordinate. Each value is separated by space.
An example of a file as input for Lambert 93 - WGS 84 converter is as follow:
